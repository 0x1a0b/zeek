Plan for 1.6:
	Originally, with 1.5 we were going to start working with --use-binpac
	as the default.  However, this has been deferred pending development
	of BinPAC++.  We might however turn on BinPAC for the SSL analyzer,
	for which the BinPAC version is more robust.  It, though, doesn't
	support storing certs to disk, which some folks use operationally.

	Given DPD means we might not filter traffic anyway, we no longer
	have such a good excuse for not dealing with IPv6 options.
