This code is a work in progress.  The library is meant to offer a relatively simple way to work with bro log 
files in python.  It is significantly slower than gawk + friends, but does feature transparent support for both
ASCII (including .gz / .bz2) and DataSeries logs.  

Note that the library uses file extensions to determine log type.
