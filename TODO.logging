List of the things not implemented yet:

    - Cluster-style remote_print.
    - Rotation support.
    - Not sure if the logging does the right thing with &optional and
      &default values. Needs testing.
    - Spawning writers in separate threads (not clear if we want that initially).
	- Check the new event-value code.
