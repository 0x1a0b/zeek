List of the things not implemented yet:

    - Cluster-style remote_print
    - Rotation support
    - Spawning writers in separate threads (not clear if we want that initially).
    - Not sure if the logging does the right thing with &optional and
      &default values. Needs testing.
    - Seems we could do some of the filter-related type checks
      currently done dynamically at startup via a TraversalCallback.
	- LogMgs' error handling
	- Put script function/constants into namespace.
	- Cleanup code.

There's probably more missing.

Questions:

    * Is giving the record column twice to create_stream too
	  redundant? (once directly, and once via the event)::

        global ssh_log: event(rec: Log);
        log_create_stream(LOG_SSH, SSH::Log, ssh_log);
