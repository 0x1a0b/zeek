List of the things not implemented yet:

    - Removing filters
    - Filter predicates
    - Filter events
    - Dynamic path function.
    - Cluster-style remote_print
    - Rotation support
    - Spawning writers in separate threads (not clear if we want that initially).
    - Not sure if the logging does the right thing with &optional and
      &default values. Needs testing.

There's probably more missing.
