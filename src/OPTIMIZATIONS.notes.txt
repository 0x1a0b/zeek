optimize for common case of global that's a function/event name

use usedef's to only restore globals that matter after a call

versions of operators that take listval's that inline the values
	rather than building val-vec's if a small number (including 0)

single val-vec maximally sized

don't consider modifying a global's element as a reaching-def for
	the global itself (glb[5] = 3)

when flushing globals, no need to do so if they've already been flushed
	(but may be tricky to be sure that code path reaches location)
	and their reaching-defs haven't changed

don't bother loading unused function parameters
