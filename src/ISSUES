TEST SUITE
	language/delete-field-set.zeek
		what does it mean to delete a field with a &default ?

	broker.opaque
	plugins.hooks
	scripts.policy.frameworks.netcontrol.catch-and-release
	scripts.policy.frameworks.netcontrol.catch-and-release-forgotten
		need help understanding these

Test suite should split into error tests vs. functionality tests

the original problem is actually problematic in practice to solve
	due to occurring in benign locations

missing vector elements due to assign-past-end

do we still care about MemoryAllocation()?

vectors don't support ++/--, nor mixed operations w/ scalars

vector of mixed-any
	e.g. language.index-assignment-invalid (expects it to fail)
		vs. language.type-check-vector

assigning vector-of-any (that's actually vector-of-string) to
	local explicitly typed as vector-of-count works in the interpreter
	and *changes the local's type* to vector-of-string

same_object() on atomic types

need to track NewSlot() denizens in case they require memory management

error messages tied back to non-reduced original

really don't want to generate "isn't used" if doing reduction since
	it induces some constant propagation of globals (could turn that
	off though)

recursion, tail-recursion
