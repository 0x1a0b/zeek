two different vector representations lead to (1) the need to synchronize
	vectors, and (2) possible syncing inconsistencies due to
	quasi-deep-copy semantics

missing vector elements due to assign-past-end

vectors don't support ++/--, nor mixed operations w/ scalars

vector of mixed-any
	e.g. language.index-assignment-invalid (expects it to fail)
		vs. language.type-check-vector

same_object() on atomic types

need to track NewSlot() denizens in case they require memory management
