- Deleting the broker_mgr leads to crashes, so I've disabled that
  for now in main (that delete didn't use to be there at all). I've
  also seen rare crashes even with that disabled, which may or may not
  have the same cause.

- Manager::PublishLogCreate() doesn't pay attention to the 'peer'
  argument yet.

- Routing isn't supported yet

- Add a function to "unlisten".

- Error logging doesn't record the relevant peer.

- Manager::ConsumeStatistics() isn't implemented.

- Is there remote logging overhead in the case that nobody is
  actually subscribed to logs?

- Data store work is pending.

- Potentially: move the new Bro-level message type (event/logs) into
  Broker. One idea would be turning that into meta data of the message
  object.
