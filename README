=================================
The Zeek Network Security Monitor
=================================

Zeek is a powerful framework for network analysis and security
monitoring.

Key Features
============

*   **Adaptable & Flexible**
    Zeek's domain specific scripting language enables site-specific
    monitoring policies and means that it is not restricted to any 
    particular detection approach.

*   **In-depth Analysis**
    Zeek ships with analyzers for many protocols, enabling
    high-level semantic analysis at the application layer.

*   **Efficient**
    Zeek targets high-performance networks and is used operationally
    at a variety of large sites.

*   **Highly Stateful**
    Zeek keeps extensive application-layer state about the network
    it monitors and provides a high-level archive of a network's 
    activity.
