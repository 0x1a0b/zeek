This directory contains scripts and templates that can be used to automate
the generation of Bro script documentation.  Several build targets are defined
by CMake:

``restdoc``

    This target uses Bro to parse policy scripts in order to generate
    reStructuredText (reST) documentation from them.  The list of scripts
    for which to generate reST documentation is defined in the
    ``CMakeLists.txt`` file in this directory.  Script documentation is
    rebuild automatically if the policy script from which it is derived
    or the Bro binary becomes out of date

    The resulting output from this target can be found in the CMake
    ``build/`` directory inside ``reST`` (a symlink to
    ``doc/scripts/rest_output``).

``doc``

    This target depends on a Python interpreter (>=2.5) and
    `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_ being installed.  Sphinx can be
    installed like::

        > sudo easy_install sphinx

    This target will first build ``restdoc`` target and then copy the
    resulting reST files as an input directory to Sphinx.

    After completion, HTML documentation can be located in the CMake
    ``build/`` directory inside ``html`` (a symlink to
    ``doc/scripts/out/html``)

``restclean``

    This target removes any reST documentation that has been generated so far.

``docclean``

    This target removes Sphinx inputs and outputs from the CMake ``build/`` dir.

To schedule a script to be documented, edit ``CMakeLists.txt`` inside this
directory add a call to the ``rest_target()`` macro.  Calling that macro
with a group name for the script is optional, but if not given, the only
link to the script will be in the master TOC tree for all policy scripts.

When adding a new logical grouping for generated scripts, create a new
reST document in ``source/<group_name>.rst`` and add some default
documentation for the group.  References to (and summaries of) documents
associated with the group get appended to this file during the
``make doc`` process.

The Sphinx source tree template in ``source/`` can be modified to add more
common/general documentation, style sheets, JavaScript, etc.  The Sphinx
config file is produced from ``conf.py.in``, so that can be edited to change
various Sphinx options, like setting the default HTML rendering theme.
There is also a custom Sphinx domain implemented in ``source/ext/bro.py``
which adds some reST directives and roles that aid in generating useful
index entries and cross-references.

See ``example.bro`` for an example of how to document a Bro script such that
``make doc`` will be able to produce reST/HTML documentation for it.
