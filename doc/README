Documentation
=============

This directory contains Bro documentation in reStructured text format
(see http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html).

Please note that for now these files are primarily intended for use on
http://www.bro-ids.org. While the Bro build process will render local
versions into ``build/doc/`` (if docutils is found), the resulting
HTML is very minimalistic and some features are not supported. In
particular, some links will be broken.


Notes for Writing Documentation
-------------------------------

* If you want to refer to a Bro script that's part of the
  distribution, use {{'`foo.bro
  <{{autodoc_bro_scripts}}/path/to/foo.html>`_'}}. For example,
  ``{{'{{autodoc_bro_scripts}}/scripts/base/frameworks/notice/main.html}}'}}``.

* If you want to refer to a page on the Bro web site, use the
  ``docroot`` macro (e.g.,
  ``{{'href="{{docroot}}/download/index.html"'}}). Make sure to
  include the ``index.html`` for the main pages, just as in the
  example.

* If you want to refer to page inside this directory, use a relative
  path with HTML extension. (e.g., ``href="quickstart.html``).
