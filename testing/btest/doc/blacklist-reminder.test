# This test will fail if there are Bro scripts that have been temporarily
# blacklisted from the documentation generation process for some reason
# (e.g. they're a work-in-progress or otherwise fail to parse).  It's meant
# to serve as a reminder that some future action may be needed to generate
# documentation for the blacklisted scripts.
